share ID per service per person


Take Alice and Bob (or Angela and Barack or...).

Usually Bob has an address book, perhaps close to his email, where he has an entry for Alice. Bob owns the whole shebang. But isn't Alice's email address _her_ info? What if her phone number changes? Even if briefly.

The 2013 addressbook is a many-to-one mapping, and all those addresses, phone numbers and GitHub names. But this conception is of one container for one direction of one realtionship. Say Bob's container, with all the contact details that Alice shares with him. She has full write permission about herself in his container. For his use finding her. So, for one direction of one realtionship there is a rich and newly owned list of details. This container could be alongside some others but it is, generally, at a place of their choosing, convenient for that relationship.


### to do

- assemble that




This may or may not become a final project for `CS50.`
