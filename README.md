share ID per service per person

Some use cases and some things with which you may be familiar that are vaguely similar.

Take Alice and Bob (or Angela and Barack or...). Alice owns a space where Bob has write permission for details about himself that he shares with her. What email address should she use to send to him? Has it changed? He controls that â€” uniquely for her point of view.

This is intended to be interpersonal and to underscore who owns these details, even though their use is extended to the person who possesses the container. Perhaps a safe deposit box is a useful comparison, although there is more symmetry with what is proposed here.

Two products come to mind that are vaguely similar, Plaxo and a certain corner of Google+.

This may or may not become a final project for `CS50.`
