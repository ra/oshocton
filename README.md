share ID per service per person

Some use cases and some things with which you may be familiar that are vaguely similar.

Take Alice and Bob (or Angela and Barack or...).

Usually Alice has an address book, perhaps close to her email, where she has an entry for Bob. Alice owns the whole shebang. But isn't Bob's email address _his_ info? What if his phone number changes? Even if briefly. ...

Two products come to mind that are vaguely similar, Plaxo and a certain corner of Google+. The first shifted ownership of the pointers (an email address for example) but it was annoying and used email as its main vehicle. G+ has a section in one's profile where I own my pointers. In the profile it's not very granular, and who owns what is traditional.
